# Pairs
This folder will contain various notebooks developed along the way towards implementing a vectorized pairs() implementation.

Currently it has:
 - Sample_pairs_with_numpy_singleloop, which is a demostration of looping over all events in oamap data, and calculating pairs for each event in a vectorized way. So, it is very inefficient, and unvectorized.
